#### Description:

Welcome to my personal web resume. This web resume showcases what a paper resume does but better! It was built using the GatsbyJS
front-end framework which leverages React. I decided to use GatsbyJS because of its concise documentation, powerful components,
and simple setup. I also wanted to practice and improve my React skills.
